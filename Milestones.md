# KVM-Drivers Development Milestones

This document outlines the phased development approach for building the KVM-Drivers computer piloting system. Each milestone builds upon previous work, with deliverables that can be tested and validated independently.

> **Last Updated:** April 5, 2026  
> **Current Phase:** Alpha-0.1.5  
> Functional implementation complete (RC v3, Mar 2026). April 2026: VS 2026 v18 build system fixes (`alpha-0.1.3`),  
> comprehensive logging overhaul (`alpha-0.1.5`), and kernel driver build infrastructure (`build_drivers.bat`).  
> Only external dependency remaining: WHQL EV cert purchase.

## Milestone 11: Full Wiring + Audit (RC v2)

**Completed:** March 30, 2026

### What Was Done

| Area | Work |
|------|------|
| Dead code | Removed `protocol_handler.cpp`, `vhidkb/device.c`, `vhidkb/queue.c` (orphaned stubs) |
| Video pipeline | BGRA→NV12 conversion + hardware encoder (`EncoderManager::EncodeFrame`) now called in `EncodeLoop`; cached staging texture (no per-frame alloc) |
| QSV encoder | Replaced 13-line incomplete stub with proper C-interface stubs + graceful `DLL-not-found` fallback |
| vhidkb driver | `vhidkbSendHidReport` now returns `STATUS_NOT_IMPLEMENTED` — triggers `SendInput` fallback in `driver_interface.cpp` instead of silently succeeding while doing nothing |
| vxinput driver | `vxinputEvtDeviceAdd` now creates IOCTL queue + `vxinputEvtIoDeviceControl` handles `SUBMIT_REPORT`, `CREATE_CONTROLLER`, `REMOVE_CONTROLLER` |
| vdisplay driver | `FinishFrameProcessing` publishes `IDXGIResource::GetSharedHandle` → `VDISPLAY_CONTEXT.SharedTextureHandle`; `IOCTL_VDISP_GET_FRAMEBUFFER` returns actual handle |
| VNC server | DXGI capture thread caches staging texture; recreates on resolution change; `AnonTLS` inner RFB loop fully wired via `thread_local t_tls` |
| Tray app | `StartDriver`/`StopDriver`/`RestartServer` wired to Windows SCM (`ServiceController`) |
| Automation | `ScreenshotActionHandler::CaptureScreen` → GDI+ PNG; `HandleMouseDrag` implemented; screenshot-on-failure wired; `display.compare` uses pixel RMSE; `TestController`/`TestDisplay` send real inputs |
| ETW logger | Kernel `LoggerWriteToEtw` implemented with `EtwRegister`/`EtwWrite` |
| WS security | `RecvExact` helper added to both servers; 16 MB frame-size limit prevents OOM from malformed frames |
| SubmitTestFrame | Added `VideoPipeline::SubmitTestFrame()` called by `IddVideoBridge::CaptureLoop` |

### Remaining Items
- WHQL EV certificate purchase (all other known gaps are resolved)

---

## Milestone 12: Gap Completions + Branding (RC v3)

**Completed:** March 30, 2026

| Gap | Implementation |
|-----|---------------|
| vhidkb VHF kernel injection | `VhfCreate` + boot-keyboard HID descriptor + `VhfReadReportSubmit`; `STATUS_DEVICE_NOT_READY` if VHF not ready → `SendInput` fallback |
| vxinput XInput-compatible gamepad | VHF HID gamepad (VID 045E/PID 028E Xbox 360); XUSB→HID 13-byte report conversion via `VhfReadReportSubmit` |
| Software H.264 encoder | `openh264_encoder.cpp` — runtime-loads `openh264.dll`; NV12→I420 deinterleave; wired into `encoder_manager.cpp` `EncoderType::Software` path |
| KVM branded icon | `docs/logo.ico` → `src/tray/Resources/KVM.ico`; wired into `App.xaml` `TaskbarIcon`, `MainWindow.xaml` `Window.Icon`, `tray.csproj` `ApplicationIcon`, `TrayIcon.cpp`; minimize-to-tray added |

---

## Milestone 13: VS 2026 Build System Fixes (alpha-0.1.3)

**Completed:** April 5, 2026  
**Tag:** `alpha-0.1.3`

| Area | Work |
|------|------|
| Compiler upgrade | Ported all usermode C++ to VS 2026 v18 (MSVC 19.4x toolchain) |
| Tray UI framework | Migrated from WinUI 3 / WindowsAppSDK to WPF — WinUI 3 not yet stable on VS2026 v18 |
| C++ standard | Resolved `std::format`, `std::span`, `std::bit_cast` unavailability under C++17; replaced with C++20-compatible equivalents |
| WDK VS integration | Documented absence of `WindowsKernelModeDriver10.0` toolset on VS2026; added NuGet + EWDK fallback paths |
| Build scripts | `scripts/build_service.bat` — direct `cl.exe` compile path for KVMService.exe without MSBuild driver toolset |
| Connection security | Cleared remaining `std::cerr`/`std::cout` from `connection_security.h`; all route to logger |

---

## Milestone 14: Logging Overhaul + Driver Build Infrastructure (alpha-0.1.5)

**Completed:** April 5, 2026  
**Tag:** `alpha-0.1.5`

### Logger core fixes (`unified_logger_user.cpp`)

| Bug / Gap | Fix |
|-----------|-----|
| Data race on `minLevel_`/`categories_` | Promoted to `std::atomic<UCHAR>`/`std::atomic<ULONG>` |
| Head-of-line blocking in `WriterLoop` | Skip non-ready slots instead of `break`; stalled writer no longer blocks subsequent committed messages |
| `totalMessages_`/`errorsLogged_`/`warningsLogged_` never incremented | Fixed; all three counters incremented on every `Log()` call |
| `OutputDebugStringA` on hot path unconditionally | Now `#ifdef _DEBUG` only |
| `LoggerInitialize` bridge re-opened file on second call | Now updates level/categories only if already running |
| No log file opened at startup | `InitServiceLogger()` in `service.cpp` opens `%PROGRAMDATA%\KVM-Drivers\KVMService.log` before any other code runs |
| No crash survivor path | `CrashHandler` (SEH `SetUnhandledExceptionFilter`) logs fatal, writes minidump to `KVMService_crash.dmp`, calls `UserLogger_FlushSync()` |
| Second-resolution timestamps only | `GetLocalTime` with `wMilliseconds`; format: `[2026-04-05 11:27:46.123]` |
| No thread ID in log lines | `[T%05lu]` field added |
| Ring size 4096, slot 1024 bytes | Ring 8192, slot 512 bytes (better cache behavior) |

### New public API

```cpp
// Process-level init (call once from wmain / ServiceMain):
UserLogger_Initialize("%PROGRAMDATA%\\KVM-Drivers\\KVMService.log",
    LOG_LEVEL_DEBUG, LOG_CATEGORY_ALL);
UserLogger_FlushSync();   // safe in SEH/crash handler
UserLogger_Shutdown();

// Global KVM_LOG_* macros — no context pointer needed:
KVM_LOG_INFO("Service", "Server started on port %d", port);
KVM_LOG_WARN("DriverInterface", "vhidkb not found (err=%lu)", GetLastError());
KVM_LOG_FATAL("Service", "UNHANDLED EXCEPTION code=0x%08lX", code);
```

### Coverage additions

- **`service.cpp`** — every lifecycle path (start, stop, SCM control codes, each failure) now `KVM_LOG_*`
- **`main.cpp`** — standalone mode, SCM dispatcher, Ctrl+C handler all structured-log
- **`driver_interface.cpp`** — per-device open result logged (OK/MISSING + error code + fallback mode)
- **`connection_security.h`** — all `std::cerr`/`std::cout` replaced with `KVM_LOG_*`

### Kernel driver build infrastructure

- **`scripts/build_drivers.bat`** — three-strategy build: WDK VS integration → NuGet WDK packages → EWDK instructions
- **`src/drivers/*/packages.config`** (all four drivers) — `Microsoft.Windows.WDK.x64 10.0.26100.2454` + SDK CPP packages
- **`BUILD.md`** — full "Three Options" section; VS 2026 compatibility noted throughout
